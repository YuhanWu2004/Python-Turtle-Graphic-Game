# Python-turtle-graphic game
This game is an application of the Python turtle module. The turtle module helps us to create 2D graphics in a simple and useful way for game-making.

Once you run the game, a game space will be drawn on the window and a pink turtle player and 6 red targets will show up inside the game space.

This is a game where you control a turtle player in a game space to tackle the red targets to gain points. 

Using the left and right arrow keys, you can make the turtle turn left or right 30 degrees every time you press.

Using the up arrow key, you can increase the speed at which the turtle moves.

When the turtle reaches the edge of the game space, it will automatically turn around and change to the opposite direction. 

Once the turtle player hits a red target, the target will disappear and the score will increase by 1.

In order to gain points, you want to let the turtle player hit as many red targets as you can.

This is a fun game that can be played forever because every time you tackle a target, a new one will be randomly generated.
